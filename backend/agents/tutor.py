Tutor Agent - turns evidence into an explanation for the learner.

Decision points: answer now, ask for more evidence, or say the evidence is insufficient; and
how to explain (normal / simple / ELI5 / key points / glossary / examples). Python validates
that an answer cites chunks that were actually retrieved, and that it passes the output guardrail.
