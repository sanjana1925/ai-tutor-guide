"""
Quiz Agent.

LLM decides: the question, options, topic, explanation, a suggested difficulty, and the source quote.
Python decides: everything else - the phase/difficulty, whether the learner's reply is an answer,
scoring, progression, accuracy, duplicate prevention, schema and grounding validation, retries,
persistence, and what the browser may see.
