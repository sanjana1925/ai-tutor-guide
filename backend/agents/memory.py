"""
Conversation memory - keeps a short rolling summary so the model never needs the full chat history.

This is a memory-maintenance step, not a decision-making agent. It runs AFTER the response has been
returned (a background task), uses at most one LLM call, and can never break a request: on any failure
the previous summary is simply kept. A new summary is discarded if it trips the input guardrail, so
injected text in a message cannot be laundered into persistent context.
